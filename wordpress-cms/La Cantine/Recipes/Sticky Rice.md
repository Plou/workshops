# Sticky Rice
*Category*: Rice

*Teaser*: Comforting stir-fried sticky rice that's perfect with any ingredients you have in the fridge. 

*About the recipe*: My grandma always makes this for me whenever I visit her and will send me home with a giant tupperware of extra. After soaking the sticky rice and dried mushrooms for an hour, the actual cooking of this dish literally comes together in under 30 min in one pan. Our family always does shiitake mushrooms and chicken but you can literally sub in any protein or veggies you want and really canâ€™t go wrong.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups of glutinous rice, soaked for at least an hour
- 2 cups dried sliced shiitake mushrooms, soaked for at least an hour
- 3 chicken thighs, diced
- 1 teaspoon corn starch
- 1 teaspoon mirin
- 4 scallions, diced (plus extra for garnish)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce

## Instructions

### Soak rice and mushrooms
1. The night before or a couple hours before you start cooking, soak glutinous rice and dried shittake mushrooms in separate bowls. 

### Cook rice
1. Fill a pot that will fit a bamboo or metal steamer with water and bring to a boil. 
2. Wet a thin cotton cloth or piece of muslin or cheesecloth that is large enough to line the steamer. Drain rice, then place the rice onto the wet cloth and wrap the excess cloth around the rice like a package.
3. Place the lid on the steamer and put the steamer on the pot. Turn the heat to medium-high and steam for 30 minutes until the grains have completely softened.

### Prep chicken and mushrooms
1. While the rice is cooking, add the chicken, corn starch, and mirin into a bowl and mix. 
2. Drain mushrooms and dice into small pieces and place into a separate bowl. 

### Cook and assemble

1. In a pan with 2 tablespoons of oil on medium-high heat, add chopped scallions, chicken, and mushrooms until cooked through, about five minutes. Turn the heat down to low and add in the cooked sticky rice. Season with soy sauce, kosher salt, and sugar.
2. Adjust seasonings as needed based on how it tastes. Top with scallions and cilantro and serve.
