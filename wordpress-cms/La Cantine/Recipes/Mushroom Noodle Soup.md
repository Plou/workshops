### Prep soup ingredients
1. In a large pot, melt butter on medium heat. Add diced onion and reduce heat to low-medium, stirring occasionally to cook until the onions are semi-transparent and softened, around 5-7 minutes. While the onions are cooking, Clean and cut mushrooms in slices and set aside. Peel ginger and cut into slices. Roughly chop the scallions.
2. Once the onions have softened, add in sliced mushrooms, ginger, and scallions and give it a stir. Increase heat to high, then pour in the mirin and sake and bring to a boil. Once boiling, let it cook of for about 5 minutes to take the edge off. Finally, add in the water, soy sauce, kosher salt and rice vinegar and bring the entire pot to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat and let the soup to lightly simmer for an hour covered. Towards the end, taste the soup and adjust for more salt or acid.

### Cook noodles and assemble
1. When almost ready to serve, prepare your toppings and noodles. 
2. For soft boiled eggs, bring a pot of water to boil, then add in eggs and cook covered for 6 minutes and 30 seconds. Once cooked, carefully remove eggs and peel when it isn't scorching hot to the touch. Cut into halves when serving.
3. For noodles, cook in a pot of boiling water according to package instructions. To serve, ladle soup in individual bowls. Add cooked noodles along with soft boiled eggs.
4. Top with your favorite herbs or acid-y crunchy things. I personally love some chopped scallions and a sliced pickled thing like daikon or turnip.
