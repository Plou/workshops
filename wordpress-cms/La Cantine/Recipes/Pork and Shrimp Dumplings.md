Servings: 30 dumplings
Time: 1.5 hours

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 2 cups flour
- 3/4 cups warm water


### Filling

- 1 lb shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 lb ground pork
- 3 carrots, microplaned
- 4 cloves garlic
- 4 scallions, chopped
- 1/2 tsp ginger
- 1 tablespoon mushroom salt (recipe here)
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 4 teaspoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil


## Instructions

### Mix dough
1. Pour flour and water into a mixing bowl. Using a silicon spatula or chopsticks, incorporate the flour and water until it's loosely combined. 
2. Then, use hands to incorporate the rest of the flour and begin the kneading the dough (it'll be messy to begin with) until it becomes smooth and the surface is uniform, around 10 minutes. When you press into the dough and it bounces back a little, you know it's done.
3. When ready, wrap dough baby in plastic wrap and let it proof for 20-30 min.

### Make filling
1. Dice shrimp into small pieces, it can be as fine or as chunky as you want! Transfer shrimp into a large mixing bowl along with the rest of the filling ingredients and mix.
2. Use fingers to mix all that juicy meat mixture goodness together. Use a circular motion with your fingers until the filling looks homogeneous and sticky, about 3 minutes.
3. When mixture is done, cover with plastic wrap and set aside in the fridge until the dough is proofed and ready.

### Make wrappers
If rolling by hand: Lightly dust a work surface with flour. When your dough is ready, roll into four cylinders with the thickness of hot dogs, then cut into 1 inch pieces. Turn each piece cut side up and with the palm of your hand, press down onto it to flatten to make a roughly flattened circle. Dust each side with flour and then with a rolling pin, flatten to create an circular wrapper to desired thickness. Repeat with the rest of your marshmellow dough pieces until you have a bunch of wrappers. Make sure to flour each wrapper as you roll them out so they don’t stick to each other and cover with plastic wrap so they don't dry out.

*Note*: Make sure to flour each wrapper as you roll them out so they don’t stick to each other and cover with plastic wrap so they don't dry out. 

### Fold and seal dumplings
You can fold the dumplings however you'd like and have fun with it! For a classic circular fold, place a spoonful of meat in the center of your flattened dough. Then pleat around the meat with small folds, pushing the meat down as the wrapper starts to close in around it. Seal the dumpling and set aside.

### Cook dumplings and serve

If steam-frying — In a nonstick pan, add generous dab of oil and place dumplings bottoms down and fry on medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes. When the bottoms have browned, add 1/4 cup of water and place a lid on top (the water will splatter when it hits the oil so just be careful!) cover and steam for 5 minutes on medium heat. If water evaporates before 5 minutes, add a tablespoon more at a time. Once the water has evaporated at the 5 minute mark, use a thin metal spatula to take dumplings out of the plan, then serve. Garnish the tops with scallions and/or any of your favorite fresh herbs.
