# Black Sesame Ricotta Cake
*Category*: Dessert

*Teaser*: Soft like cake yet chewy like mochi, this black sesame mochi cake uses ricotta to keep the texture super moist and light, a technique adapted from mother herself Ina Garten. 

*About the recipe*: Continuing on my series of paying homage to Ina Garten's recipes and making them Asian, this next recipe is a play off of Ina's blueberry ricotta breakfast cake. I changed up the flavor profile and made it a black sesame cake using glutinous rice flour instead of regular all-purpose (making this cake gluten-free!). The ricotta in her recipe adds lightness and moisture, which lends itself well in this mochi cake recipe allowing it to be chewy yet still soft like a regular cake. This mochi cake will make your kitchen smell like the most caramel-y, nutty, butter factory - a preview of what's to come for your taste buds.

## Ingredients

### Batter
- 1 stick of unsalted butter
- 6 tablespoons black sesame seeds, plus extra for sprinkling
- 1 1/2 cups glutinous rice flour
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup whole-milk ricotta
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- White sesame seeds, for sprinkling

### Topping (optional)
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1/4 cup ricotta
- 1 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt
- Strawberries, halved


## Instructions

### Brown butter
1. Heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Add butter to the pan and stir frequently as it starts to melt and bubble. Look for little brown specks to start to appear and the color to change from yellow to a light amber, 3 to 5 minutes.
2. Once it’s lightly browned, remove from the heat and transfer to a heatproof container to cool.

### Make batter and bake
1. Preheat an oven to 350°F.
2. In a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, grind sesame seeds until it's a powder.
3. Add ground sesame seeds into a large mixing bowl along with cooled down brown butter, glutinous rice flour, sugar, kosher salt, baking powder, eggs, ricotta, sour cream, and vanilla extract.
4. Mix until the batter is smooth, then pour into a oiled 9 inch cake tin.
5. Bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when stuck into the center.
6. Once cooked, remove from oven and let it cool for about 30 minutes to let the mochi cake set.

### Assemble
1. Once the cake has cooled, cut into slices. You can enjoy the cake as is and it's still delicious! But if you're feeling fancy, make optional toppings.
2. Cut strawberries into halves.
3. Whisk together sour cream, ricotta, maple syrup, and kosher salt.
4. Dollop tart maple cream on top of each slice and and add a strawberry half to serve.
