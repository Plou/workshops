## At a glance
Servings: 3-4 pancakes
Time: 1 hr 45 min

## Ingredients

### For Pancake
- 2 cups flour
- 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp of boiling water
- 3 tbsp room temp water
- 3/4 tsp of salt
- 1 tsp canola oil


### For Scallion Oil

- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 1 1/2 tbsp of flour
- 4 scallions chopped
- 1 tsp salt

## Instructions

### Mix the dough
1. Mix together flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Take your boiling water and slowly pour into the flour mixture and mix at the same time until forms small clumps
2. Pour room temperature water in and give it a good mix until incorporated.

### Knead and do the first proof
1. Flour a hard surfaced area. Take your dough out of the bowl and start turning and kneading it. If the dough gets to sticky you can add a little bit of flour as you knead but only when necessary (more flour equals harder pancakes). Knead for 10 minutes or until your dough is one smooth ball. You should be able to press your finger into it and it should have some tackiness and slightly bounce back. Cover mixing bowl with plastic wrap and rest for 20 minutes.

### Divide and do a second proof
1. When ready, unwrap plastic wrap and pour 1 teaspoon of canola oil on top of the dough. Knead the dough until the oil is fully incorporated and the dough is smooth.
2. Roll the dough into log and divide into 3-4 equal parts (3 for bigger pancakes, 4 for smaller ones).
3. Use your palm to flatten the dough into rough flat circles. Lightly oil each dough and put on a plate.
4. Cover with plastic wrap and proof for 1 hour.

### Make scallion oil
1. While the dough is proofing, place salt, chopped scallions, and flour into a heatproof bowl. Heat the canola oil until it starts to sizzle.
2. Carefully add the oil into the heatproof bowl with other ingredients, it will make a loud sizzle noise when your pour it in so be careful of the hot oil. This process really enhances the scallion flavor.
3. Mix the scallion oil together and set aside.

### Form pancakes
1. When ready, uncover dough and roll into a flat, thin oval (thickness roughly of a tortilla). Lightly spoon a thin coat of scallion oil evenly onto the dough.

2. Roll the dough tightly width wise so it becomes like a long snake. Start from one end of the snake and coil your dough like a cinnamon roll, When you reach the end of the roll, press the end of the snake into the bottom of your cinnamon roll to attach.

3. Take your palm and press firmly into your coiled dough to create a flat circle (if oil spills out that's okay). Roll out your dough again until it's flattened and at your desired thickness (6-8 inches for a thinner pancake, 4-5 inches for a thicker one). You can repeat this process again with the just flattened pancake to make even more layers, but definitely optional.

### Cook pancakes
1. Heat a cast iron or non stick pan with some canola oil on medium heat.
2. Place pancake into the pan and cook on both sides, flipping back and forth until lightly browned.
3. Serve warm.
