# Sweet Potato Mochi Balls with Gochujang Butter Sauce
*Category*:  Noodles

*Teaser*: I'm not a regular sweet potato, I'm a cool sweet potato. Sweet potato mochi balls actually. And I'm tossed in a gochujang parmesan butter sauce!

*About the recipe*: If I were spicy Asian mom and assigned sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving, these sweet potato mochi balls would be my contribution. The classic mashed sweet potato is mixed with corn starch and glutinous rice flour to make a pliable dough that gets rolled into balls. After a quick dip in a hot jacuzzi of boiling water, they become delightfully chewy and ready to be coated in the sauce of your dreams. I couldn't help but think of spicy Korean tteokbokki so these sweet potato mochi balls are paired with a gochujang parmesan butter sauce that make it truly worthy of the award for most fun dish at the Thanksgiving table.

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, boiled whole (3 whole sweet potatoes)
- 2 1/2 cups corn starch
- 2 cups glutinous rice flour
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt

### Sauce
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2/3 cup mochi water (leftover water from boiling mochi balls)
- 1/2 cup parmesan, finely shredded
- 2 tablespoons gochujang
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons rice vinegar

### Toppings
- White sesame seeds
- Scallions, finely chopped


## Instructions

### Prep sweet potatoes and make dough
1. In a pot of boiling water, boil whole sweet potatoes for 25 minutes until completely softened and a knife easily pierces through them. Allow them to cool, then peel the skins off and discard. The weight of the boiled sweet potatoes should be 1 1/2 pounds. Place sweet potatoes into a large mixing bowl and mash with a fork until smooth like mashed potatoes.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together corn starch, glutinous rice flour, and kosher salt . Pour into the mixing bowl of mashed sweet potatoes and knead with hands. It'll start out feeling like a clumpy but don't worry! It'll come together after a few minutes of kneading. Once the dough has come together, continue kneading on a work surface until it becomes a smooth ball of dough that feels like the consistency of Play-Doh.

*Note*: If the dough is too sticky still, just add glutinous rice flour 1/4 cup at a time and knead until the dough feels like Play-Doh 

### Make balls
1. Take a small chunk of dough and with your hands and roll into a smooth ball the size of a grape. Repeat until you've used all the dough.
2. Bring a pot of water to boil. Drop the mochi balls in and boil for 2 minutes until cooked through and chewy on the inside. Save 2/3 cups of the mochi water , then drain the mochi balls and set aside with a drizzle of oil so they don't stick to each other.
*Note*:  This is the most time consuming part so if you get tired of making balls, just freeze any leftover dough and make another day! 


### Make sauce and assemble
1. In a large pan on medium heat, melt butter . Add the mochi water along with parmesan, gochujang, kosher salt, brown sugar, and rice vinegar . Mix everything together until combined and continue to simmer and stir for 4 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Add mochi balls into the pan and stir until evenly coated with sauce. Serve in bowls with a sprinkle of sesame and finely chopped scallion and enjoy!
